Description:
This project is my base scaffolding for any MEAN stack project.
- Uses Angular 2.
- Has tests wired in already testing server health, API endpoints, and Angular 2 components.
- Has build system set up with Gulp.
- Has Procfile specified for easy deployment to Heroku
- Has local MongoDB instance wired up.
- Connected to Travis CI. Continually tested and deployed on success: https://travis-ci.org/aconfee.

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION

After developing and building, pushing to git will run through Travis CI.
- lints js
- runs tests
- deploys to Heroku

Can see each deployment here: https://travis-ci.org/aconfee

TERMINAL COMMANDS

SETUP:
- `npm install` -- Installs all dependencies.
- `npm run build` -- Uglifies, minifies, distributes, and builds project.

DEVELOP:
- `npm run dev:start` -- Starts server with nodemon. Restarts server on file changes.
- `npm run dev:watch` -- Watches all specified files and redistributes them on saves.
- `npm run dev:lint` -- Show all js warnings and errors.
- `npm test` -- Runs Mocha unit tests.

DEPLOY:
- `npm run deploy` -- Deploys code to Heroku.


FIRST TIME SETUP

1. Clone the project from github.

2. Run `npm install` and `npm run build` to be all set up locally.
  - You can test to make sure everything works by running `npm run dev:start` and viewing on localhost:3000.

3. Initialize a new github repo and push to it.
  - Delete .git folder and reinitialize with `git init`. This also resets remotes.

4. Activate the repo in Travis CI: https://travis-ci.org/profile/aconfee.

5. Prepare For Heroku Deployment:
  - Run `heroku create`
  - Verify Heroku remote was added with `git remote -v`
  - Deploy with `git push heroku master`
  - Open app with `heroku open`

6. Set up Heroku deployment from Travis CI
  - Install Travis CI command line client `gem install travis -v 1.8.2 --no-rdoc --no-ri`
  - Get your Heroku auth token by running `heroku auth:token`. Copy this.
  - Encrypt your Heroku token with `travis encrypt -r aconfee/MEANTemplateV2 --org` (then paste in the token when prompted with 'Reading stdin.. press ctrl+D to finish')
  - Copy the encrypted token and add to 'api_key: secure:' in .travis.yml
  - Deploy to github. Travis should run everything and deploy to Heroku when finished.

7. Set up MongoDB
  - Add MongoDB to the heroku app with `sudo heroku addons:create mongolab`
  - Get the URI with `sudo heroku config | grep MONGODB_URI`
  - Add the URI to the production Heroku environment with `heroku config:set MONGOLAB_URI=<my uri>`
  - For good measure, also add `heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production`
  - Test this is working by deploying to Heroku and viewing the logs.
